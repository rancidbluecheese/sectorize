Transform author archives into elegant sector-based content organization with automatic SEO optimization.

== Description ==

**Sectorize** is an elegant, plug-and-play WordPress plugin that transforms author archives into flexible sector-based content organization with automatic SEO optimization.

= ‚≠ê Why Sectorize? =

* **Zero Configuration**: Install, activate, and it works immediately
* **Elegant Architecture**: Repurposes WordPress's built-in author system - no custom post types or taxonomies
* **SEO-Ready**: Automatic JSON-LD schema, optimized titles, and canonical URLs
* **Smart Redirects**: 301 redirects from `/author/username` to clean `/sector/nickname` URLs
* **Collective Authorship**: Uses your admin nickname for consistent site branding

= üéØ Perfect For =

* **Content Creators & Bloggers** - Organize content by type without showing individual author names
* **Industry Portals** - Create sectors like "Finance," "Technology," "Healthcare"
* **Corporate Sites** - Organize by department: "Marketing," "Sales," "Support"
* **Regional Content** - Geographic organization: "North America," "Europe," "Asia Pacific"

= ‚ú® How It Works =

Sectorize cleverly repurposes WordPress's author system:

* **Users = Sectors**: Each user represents a content sector
* **Nicknames = URLs**: User nicknames become `/sector/{nickname}/` URLs
* **Posts = Content**: Assign posts to users for automatic sector organization
* **SEO = Automatic**: Schema markup and optimization included

= üîß Features =

* Automatic URL Rewriting: `/author/john-doe` ‚Üí `/sector/finance`
* Schema.org JSON-LD markup for articles
* SEO-friendly 301 redirects from legacy author URLs
* Compatible with Yoast SEO, Rank Math, and The SEO Framework
* Works with Gutenberg and Classic Editor
* Zero configuration required
